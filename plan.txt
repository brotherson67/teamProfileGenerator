write tests to check for what an object returns
    - will the object return a name
    - does it answer all questions

Create objects taht will have the methods for each of the inquirer questions

inquirer questions  
    whats the managers name
    how what is their employee id
    what is their email
    what is the location addy

HOW TO ASK INITIAL QUESTIONS
    There can be 3 main parts
        initialize manager 
        ask if they want to continue
        ask employee possition and init ovject methods
            or
        end app and generate the page
